Greetings! 👋 I'm Efthimis, a .NET Developer located in Thessaloniki. 
<br/><br/>
During my working hours, I work as a Senior .NET Engineer 🛠️, 
<br/>applying my skills and expertise to shape the digital landscape.

During my off-hours, I immerse myself in the world of Raspberry Pi, explore intriguing projects and libraries on Github, and hone my abilities by staying abreast of tech advancements and programming trends, Besides that I also find joy for history, nature, and wildlife documentaries.

When it comes to software, I lean towards the ethos of FOSS. I can be proudly identified as an Arch Linux enthusiast ❤️, although my go-to devices include a BMAX mini PC and a trusty 💻 MacBook Pro.
